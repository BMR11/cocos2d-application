=====================================
cocos2d-iphone (0.7.3) Xcode Template
=====================================

I have Xcode for iPhone OS 2.0 in /Developer
I have Xcode for iPhone OS 3.0 in /Developer3.0

I added this project template to:
/Developer3.0/Library/Xcode/Project Templates/Other 

and installed with: 
git clone git://github.com/tjweir/cocos2d-application.git

Static linking is awesome.
